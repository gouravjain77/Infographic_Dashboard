# Infographic Dashboard
## Project Description
This project showcases an infographic-style dashboard built in Power BI to provide a comprehensive mid-year performance review of Kraken Koffeeâ€™s new Florida sales region. The dashboard integrates analytical storytelling with creative visuals to highlight key performance metrics such as total sales ($698K), transactions (149K), average order value ($4.69), and store-level performance trends across Orlando, Tampa, and Miami.

By blending traditional BI analytics with an infographic layout, this dashboard presents data in a visually engaging and easily digestible format, making insights more accessible to business users and executives.
