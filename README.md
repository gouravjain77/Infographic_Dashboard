# Infographic Dashboard
## Project Description
This project showcases an infographic-style dashboard built in Power BI to provide a comprehensive mid-year performance review of Kraken Koffeeâ€™s new Florida sales region. The dashboard integrates analytical storytelling with creative visuals to highlight key performance metrics such as total sales ($698K), transactions (149K), average order value ($4.69), and store-level performance trends across Orlando, Tampa, and Miami.

By blending traditional BI analytics with an infographic layout, this dashboard presents data in a visually engaging and easily digestible format, making insights more accessible to business users and executives.

## Importance of Infographic Dashboards:
Infographic dashboards transform conventional analytical reports into visually immersive data stories. Instead of relying solely on tables and charts, they use design elements, icons, and colour-coded visuals to help viewers grasp key insights at a glance.
This approach enhances executive communication, improves data-driven storytelling, and increases stakeholder engagement by making analytics both informative and aesthetically appealing.

## Design Approach:
The background and thematic layout of this dashboard were created in PowerPoint to establish a branded and visually cohesive structure. The background was then imported into Power BI, where dynamic visuals were overlaid on top to create an interactive infographic experience that combines design flexibility with analytical power.
